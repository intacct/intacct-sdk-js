## Xometry Repository Info

This repository is a fork of intacct/intacct-sdk-js to add missing fields and change the way a couple cases are handled, in order to fix errors we encountered while using the upstream version of this SDK.

The application in this repository is currently **deployed** as a package dependency of [accounting-automation-service](https://github.com/xometry/accounting-automation-service).

Ensure PRs are set to merge to the `main` branch not the original Intacct `master` branch.
To trigger deployment of any changes on merge make sure you add `feat:` to the beginning of the PR merge commit title.
